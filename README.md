Overview of the project

Student Grade Tracker

Objective

The objective of this student grades management program is to allow users to easily input and track grades for different subjects, calculate the average grade, and display the overall grade along with the corresponding letter grade and GPA. It aims to provide a simple yet effective tool for managing and summarizing student performance. This program also serves as an educational example for learning basic Python programming concept.


Key Activities

1. Input Grades: Prompting the user to enter the number of subjects and the grades for each subject.
2. Calculate Average Grade: Summing the grades and calculating the average grade across all subjects.
3. Determine GPA and Letter Grade: Using the average grade to calculate the corresponding letter grade and GPA through a defined function.
4. Display Results: Showing the user the average grade, letter grade, and GPA in a clear and concise manner.
These activities ensure that the program effectively manages student grades and provides a comprehensive summary of their performance.

Technologies

1. Python Programming Language: The entire program is written in Python, a powerful and versatile language that is beginner-friendly.
2. Standard Input/Output: Utilizes Python's built-in `input()` function to get user input and `print()` function to display results.
3. Conditional Statements: Uses `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements to determine the letter grade and GPA based on the average grade.
4. Arithmetic Operations: Performs basic arithmetic operations like summation and averaging of grades.
5. Lists: Uses lists to store and manage grades entered by the user.

These technologies and concepts form the foundation of the student grades management program, making it simple yet effective for tracking and managing student performance.
